This client is written in `C++` and uses [Thorium Browser](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium) as its base.
Please go show the creator some love and support! âœ¨

### What am I looking at? ðŸ‘€

*We have two things here!*

First, a Ublock Filter for those who want just a simple solution.
> Keep in mind that until further notice, the filter still needs a lot of patch work. Bugs are expected.

Secondly, a YouTube Client app written in `C++`. Keep in mind it's an *extremely* simple CPP script that just runs Thorium in app mode while opening YouTube!
> You can find a finished copy in the releases!

IMPORTANT NOTES ðŸ“ƒ

- If you want to add more extensions to the client, go into /src/THORIUM.BAT.
> This will launch Thorium in its normal mode, and you can add whatever you would like.
